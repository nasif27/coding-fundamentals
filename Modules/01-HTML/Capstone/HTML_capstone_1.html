            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello readers! My name is Nasif Abdullah. People always call me Nasif or Sif. I am 27 years old this year and I feel old enough. Let's talk about my education background. I was graduating from a university in Bachelor Degree of Electrical and Electronics Engineering since 2021. I also have Diploma in the same field and graduated from the same university since 2017. Currently, I'm working at a company in Penang as a Product Devopment Engineer (PDE) which is junior level in the same field that I studied. The turning point why I want to make a career change from PDE to Sofware Engineer or Software Developer is because I found myself have passion in writing codes and understanding them. Back in 2020 to 2021 which is the year I'm still studying. I have a subject known as 'Capstone' but I don't remember the real name of that subject. This subject require the group of 3 students to implement the idea, knowledge and skill to make an IoT (Intenet of  Things) project. So, that time we need to have knowledge in electrical, function of the sensors and the most important thing is coding. That time we used Arduino Mega and Uno board as part of our project which is microcontroller. So, we have to use Arduino programming language which is based on C/C++. That time I wrote all codes by myself until the project function pretty well but the codes are very messy because I wrote it for the first time from the scratch. The fun fact is I can spend all day long, day and night to make the codes well function without feeling tired. The same thing also happened at the company that I work now. I'd been assigned by my senior to do an automation tool for the software that we had been used to do simulation. That tool had been successfully developed using Python language. I can code day and night without feeling tired but satisfying just like what I did in college. So, from there I decided to proceed with my passion and prioritize it. That's why I choose Sigma School as a platform for me to gain more knowledge in coding although I know it's not possible to become self-thought programmer. There's a quote that sound like this 'If you want to go faster, go alone. But, if you want to go further, go together.'</p>
